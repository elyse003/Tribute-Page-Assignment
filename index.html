            <h2>About Marie Curie</h2>
            <p>
                Marie Curie was a trailblazer in the scientific world, breaking barriers as a woman in a male-dominated field. 
                She revolutionized our understanding of radioactivity, a term she coined, and her discoveries continue to influence modern science and medicine. 
                Despite facing societal challenges and personal hardships, including the loss of her husband and partner in science, Pierre Curie, 
                she persevered to achieve remarkable feats. Marie's dedication not only earned her global recognition but also paved the way for women in science.
